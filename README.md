# genotype_discordance_checker
For use at former company where we need two independent results to report out a genotype. Checks gel maps (generated from the maps program I made)
for manually entered genotypes and returns samples that have two different genotypes entered for the same disease, or any samples that
have 'FAIL' for the genotype.
